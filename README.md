Script that takes user-inputted initial time of Buford, GA Dam water release as well as location where user intends to fish and returns the time at which the period for safe fishing begins, based off of generally accepted water flow rates. Prevents user from fishing at peak water level and flow rate just shortly after water is released at the dam
